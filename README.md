Uses latest data from John Hopkins University. Historical data is pulled from the [OWID repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/blob/master/public/data/jhu/full_data.csv), which collates all the previous dates into one CSV file rather than splitting the data by each day. Current data is pulled from [JHU's repository](https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/tree/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_daily_reports).
